# Airbnb Clone Project

## üìñ Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves building a full-stack application that includes backend systems, database design, API development, and security measures.

### **Project Goals**
- Develop a scalable booking platform with real-world architecture.
- Practice collaborative workflows using GitHub.
- Implement secure APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and strong database design.

---

## üë• Team Roles
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for creating RESTful APIs, handling business logic, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and manages the relational database schema and ensures data consistency.
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds the user interface, integrates with backend APIs, and ensures a responsive design.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Implements CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment, and ensures scalability using tools like Docker.
- **QA Engineer**: Tests the application for bugs, performance, and security vulnerabilities.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Django**: Web framework for building secure and scalable backend services.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database to store structured data like users, bookings, and properties.
- **GraphQL**: Provides a flexible query system for client-server communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows for testing and deployment.
- **NGINX/Gunicorn**: Handles server deployment and request routing.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design
### **Entities and Key Fields**
- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`
- **Properties**
  - `id`, `owner_id (FK)`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`
- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id (FK)`, `property_id (FK)`, `check_in`, `check_out`
- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id (FK)`, `property_id (FK)`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id (FK)`, `amount`, `status`, `transaction_date`

### **Relationships**
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Review** is linked to both a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: Register, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Property Management**: Add, edit, and delete property listings with images and details.
- **Booking System**: Book properties, view booking history, and manage reservations.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing for bookings.
- **Review System**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering by location, price, and availability.

---

## üîê API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication to verify user sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for features like property management.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting API requests.
- **Data Encryption**: Secure sensitive data like passwords and payment info.

**Why Security Matters**
- Protects **user data** from leaks.
- Ensures **secure payments** and financial integrity.
- Maintains **platform trust** and prevents fraud.

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline
**What is CI/CD?**
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automate the build, test, and deployment process.

**Why Important?**
- Reduces human error.
- Ensures faster, consistent deployments.
- Improves collaboration and code quality.

**Tools**
- GitHub Actions (automated testing & deployment)
- Docker (containerized environments)
- NGINX & Gunicorn (production-ready deployment)
